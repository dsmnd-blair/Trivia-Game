# Trivia-Game
this is a trivia game based on the movie "my neighbor totoro". it has five multiple choice questions and five true or false. 
the timer starts at two minutes. nothing happens when the timer runs out so that is pseudocode. 
the player can only select one answer.
its very basic and ugly imo but if i stare at this code for any longer i will cry
